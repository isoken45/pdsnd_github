# Explore US Bikeshare Data
This project was created in November 2021 as part of the requirements to complete the Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree.

### Description
This project makes use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€“ Chicago, New York City and Washington. A code was written to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. A script was written to take in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
